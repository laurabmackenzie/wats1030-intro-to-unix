I found the name of the movie: Zardoz
I looked for it using grep in challenge files and got this:

```
./challenge_files/test2/explicabo_dolor.txt:Aperiam ipsam perferendis ut non est
. Harum numquam officia veniam ea vel dolor. Unde vel vitae minima optio quas al
iquam vel. Enim voluptatem autem culpa saepe. Alias ipsa Zardoz praesentium occa

```

Didn't know what to do after that!!
